**Overall structure**

Extract answer -> use different models (train, test split!) (question + context = predicted answer) (often used: DistilBert, roBerta)
Evaluation -> compare intended with predicted answer
Dashboard -> 
Generate more difficult contexts (answers with multiple senteces answering multiple questions) -> no formal specification of the context
Generate more questions -> similar to existing questions

**Questions from Q&A:**
