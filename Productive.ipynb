        "\n",
        "After creating and praparing the QA-dataset, it's time for generating model output for different Huggingface models.\n",
        "Since it's not possible to feed the models with humanly understandable text, we have to preprocess inputs, i.e. the questions of the QA-dataset.\n",
        "As we found out, QA-models, or their tokenizer respectively, expect to get a question and an associated context with which the question can be answered as input.\n",
        "This is very easy for open-ended (oe) questions like 'NUMBER' or 'DATE', as we can directly pose it to the model without making any changes.\n",
        "But it's getting cumbersome for multiple-choice questions like 'SINGLE_SELECT' and 'MULTI_SELECT', where one has to choose from different options.\n",
        "There we have to pass the context as often as there are options, saved as a list.\n",
        "We also pass a list as a question, whereby each entry of the question (of the QA-dataset) is linked to an option.\n",
        "In doing so, the model is able to chose one of the options as the most likely one.\n",
        "In contrast to the model of the oe questions, which returns the most likely start and end position of the answer in the context.\n",
        "Besides, we'll use a text-summarization pipeline to summarize the context of 'TEXT' questions, as it doesn't seem reasonable to extract an answer out of these questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For handling all of that mentioned above, following functions come in to play:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   tokenize_function():\n",
        "Converts string input into tokens \"readable\" for the model.\n",
        "For that it differentiates between the different question types as mentioned above.\n",
        "*   model_output(): the \"main\" operator for generating model output\n",
        "Needs a model, which should create the output, its tokenizer and the questions, for which output should be created.\n",
        "Additionally, one can pass on the metrics for evaluating the model output for the mc and the oe questions on the fly.\n",
        "To handle 'TEXT' questions, one also has to pass a text-summarizing pipeline. Hands on the task to the following functions. These create the model's output, a list of logits\n",
        "  * single_select_model_output(): one logit for each option.\n",
        "  It chooses the option where the logit is highest\n",
        "  * multi_select_model_output(): one logit for each option.\n",
        "  It derives a standard normal distribution from the logits distribution and chooses every option that is 40% above the mean\n",
        "  * text_model_output(): just summarizes the context\n",
        "  * number_model_output(): calculates the most likely start and end token and outputs everything in between\n",
        "  * date_model_output(): as in number_model_output(), but auxiliary function \"convert_date_format()\" converts the output to the format \"yyyy-MM-dd\", if possible\n",
